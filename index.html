<blockquote><img src="/img/IMG954892.jpg"><br>Hello and welcome to ClimbCamelback!  My name is Jason Glashan and I am your very entertaining guide that will get you up and down Camelback Mountain.  I grew up in the Minneapolis MN area and lived there most of my life. I decided the cold winters weren’t for me anymore so I moved to Arizona in 2008.  I realized immediately that hiking was a great way to stay fit and started offering guided hikes so others could experience a piece of our beautiful state of Arizona while being active.</blockquote>
